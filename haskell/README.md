# Haskell exercises
This folder contains 6 exercises in Haskell, which I did during my course in Haskell.
<br>Each exercise has its own description and tests.

## Testing an exercise

I will show how to test ex1code, but the process is similar for all the exercises.
<br>Do the following to test ex1code:

1. Install Haskell on your computer
2. Navigate to ex1code
3. Build the project, by enter the following in the command window:
```
stack build
```
4. Run the tests, by entering the following in the command window:
```
stack test
```
